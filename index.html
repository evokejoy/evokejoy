<h1>Paulina J.</h1>
<section><p>Yosemite is my FAVORITE place to travel to. I've been to over 20 states, but in my opinion, nothing beats the beauty of California's Sierra Nevada. I usually spend anywhere from 4-8 weeks per year in the Sierras. I've been doing this for over 2 years. It has got to the point where I can travel from my family's home (I like to call it Home2) to Yosemite (about 30 minutes to the gate) without directions. I can navigate the park's main features and give something of a tour. I cry every time I visit after some months have passed because the beauty of the Valley changes as the seasons do.</p>
